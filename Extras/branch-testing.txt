When testing a development branch the following changes need to
be made (and then reversed after merging with master:)

1 Change the two curl commands in the README.md file-
    Substitute the branch name for `master`.
2 Change the `repo.sh` script-
    Do the same in line 6.

When merging, remember to change back to `master` in these
three locations.
