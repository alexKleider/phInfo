Some notes that we might amalgamate into the README file.


Some random person on the internet says about 22 students is the
real-world maximum.

    Alex,
    We use 128GB microSD's in RPi3 and RPi Zero W's almost every day.

We almost all use the $44.99:

But many of us also use the $44.39:

PS Amazon can NOT be trusted, as the very same links have led to
different products arriving at our doors.  Still, we've had very
good luck with both above.

PPS beware of your RPi's overheating and self-throttling etc --
be sure to test use the command to monitor their temperature if
folks will be using them in hot (or even warm) conditions indoors.
A heatsink is not enough.  Many of my Haitian friends just run
their RPi 3s with the top off, which indeed solves the problem as
an indoor breeze is sufficient.  It may seem unprofession but it
works.  Considering most all RPi cases make practicall ventilation
impossible, and active cooling with a fans-than-break is something
nobody's wanted to bother with so far...
