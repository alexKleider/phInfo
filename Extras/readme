    Alex,
    We use 128GB microSD's in RPi3 and RPi Zero W's almost every day.

We almost all use the $44.99:

But many of us also use the $44.39:

PS Amazon can NOT be trusted, as the very same links have led to
different products arriving at our doors.  Still, we've had very
good luck with both above.


Beware (Adam Holt, personal communication) "of your RPi overheating
and self-throttling etc -- be sure to test using the command to
monitor their temperature if folks will be using them in hot (or
even warm) conditions indoors.  A heatsink is not enough.  Many of
my Haitian friends just run their RPi 3s with the top off, which
indeed solves the problem as an indoor breeze is sufficient.  It
may seem unprofessional but it works.  Considering most all RPi
cases make practical ventilation impossible, and active cooling
with a fan-that-breaks is something nobody's wanted to bother with
so far".
