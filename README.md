# The Raspberry Pi as a Content Server

You can read these instructions by pointing your browser to
https://github.com/alexKleider/phInfo/tree/master

## Introduction

This directory hierarchy attempts to provide all that is needed
(information and support files) to make a `Raspberry Pi` into a
content server running the `Pathagar Book Server` as well as one
or more static content sites suitable for classroom or library use.
Since `Raspbian`, the default `Raspberry Pi` `OS`, is `Debian`
based, these instructions (with modifications discussed in the
text) should be applicable to any other `Debian` based system.

The goal is to end up with a device that provides:

* the Pathagar Book Server, and 
* one or more static sites.

## Terminology

In the text that follows it's important that the reader is clear
about which computer is being used and for what purpose.

The `Raspberry Pi` (or any other `Debian` based machine that you
may be trying to configure to use as a content server) will be
referred to as your `target` machine.  Your laptop or other
(preferably Linux) computer (it could even be another `Raspberry
Pi`) will be referred to as your `staging` machine.  It will be
assumed that your `staging` machine will have `Linux` as its
operating system. There's a good chance that an Apple (running
OSX) will work the same (not tested) but if your OS is by
`MicroSoft`, you'll have to look for instruction elsewhere.


## The Process

The process is divided up into the following steps.
Some are specific for the `Raspberry Pi`. These include 
the first two and the 4th.
The 6th (Configuring ...,)  7th (Updating ...)( and the 9th
(Network ...) are also specific to the `Raspberry Pi` but if
you are using some other target machine, these same instructions
could probably be fairly easily adapted.  Updating and Upgrading
(the 7th item) might work as is since pretty standard `Debian`
commands are used; Network Setup will almost certainly differ.  
Look over the code and modify to suit your use case.

Sensible defaults are chosen for everything so if using
a Raspberry Pi, there'll be no necessity to modify anything.

### Raspberry Pi Acquisition

The [Vilros basic starter kit](https://www.amazon.com/Vilros-Raspberry-Basic-Starter-Kit/dp/B01D92SSX6/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1478455788&sr=1-4&keywords=raspberry+pi)
is recommended since it includes the required power cord, and a
protective case<sup>[9](#9cooling)</sup>. WiFi is built in to this newer (v3) model
`Raspberry Pi`. The older (v2) model will work but a separate
[USB WiFi dongle](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Wireless-Adapter-Dongle/dp/B00GFAN498/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1486968857&sr=1-1&keywords=CanaKit+WIFI)
must be added.

### SD Card Preparation

Since the goal is to set up a content server, and since the
capacity of your SD Card will dictate the amount of content
it's possible to provide, choose an SD Card of commensurate
capacity<sup>[1](#1sdcard)</sup>. In general, 'more is better.'
The following products have been used successfully:
[64GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-microSDXC-Standard-Packaging-SDSQUNC-064G-GN6MA/dp/B010Q588D4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488675440&sr=8-1&keywords=64+gig+micro+sd+card)
and
[128GB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XWZWYVP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
We've heard that the following
[128GB card](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-microSDXC-Standard-Packaging-SDSQUNC-128G-GN6MA/dp/B010Q57S62/)
will also function properly.

As mentioned, this guide assumes that you are using Linux on your
staging machine.  Microsoft Windows users might find this
[link](https://hackernoon.com/raspberry-pi-headless-install-462ccabd75d0)
useful.

Use the browser on your staging machine to find **RASPBIAN**
[here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
<sup>[5](#5oldraspian)</sup>.
Pick the **LITE** (not **DESKTOP**) version.  If you know
about `Torrent`, by all means use it; otherwise just click 
on the `Download ZIP` button and your browser will download
the zip file.  Where it will end up depends on your browser's
settings.  `~/Downloads` would be the logical place for it to
end up.  The download process may take a long time. Be sure it
has completed before going on. If a listing of your `~/Download`
directory contains a file ending in `.zip.part`, then the
download is NOT yet complete.

While at the ``raspbian`` download site, it would be a
good idea to make a copy of the ``SHA-256`` check-sum shown below
the ``Download ZIP`` button.

The remainder of this section involves use of the command line
on your staging machine.

Change into your `Downloads` directory: the directory into which
the zip file was downloaded.  Double check again that none of the
files in that directory end in `.zip.part` and then enter the
following commands substituting the directory name if your
download went else where:

        cd ~/Downloads
        ls -lA

... and expect to see output which includes a line that looks 
like the following:

`-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  362914661 Nov 12 09:49 2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.zip`

The name of the zip file will reflect version updates so may not
be the same.  Substitute the name you get for the one shown above.

        
        sha1sum 2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.zip

The output should match the ``SHA-256`` check-sum you copied from the
download page.

Next, unzip the file:

        unzip 2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.zip

This results in the appearance of another file named the same but
without the trailing ".zip".

The challenge now is to unequivocally establish the `device name`
your computer assigns to the SD card so that you can first unmount
any of the possibly auto-mounted volumes associated with this device
and then copy the raspbian image to this device.  Each device might
contain one or more volumes, each designated by appending a digit to
the device name.

The safest way to discover the device name is to run the `mount`
command:

        mount

... once before inserting the SD card into your staging machine's
card reader, and then again after doing so.  The second time you
run the mount command, there will be one or more new lines that
weren't there before.  Each of these lines begin with a volume name.
Ignoring the ending digit of one of these volume names provides you
with the device name.  In my case, the beginning of such a (very
long) line (that spills over) is

        /dev/sdb1 on /media/alex/6330-3266 type vfat ....

So on my staging machine the device name is `/dev/sdb`.
Make a note of this device (what ever it is on your staging machine.)
You will need to know it latter.  Also note how many such lines there
are; that is to say, how many `volumes` are listed, each differing
by the digit appended to the device name.

For each volume name, issue the following command:

        umount /dev/sdb1
        umount /dev/sdb2
        # etc....

until all are unmounted.

So we'll assume the device is `/dev/sdb`; substitute as appropriate. 
Getting this wrong can be hazardous!!  Making the appropriate
substitutions as necessary, run the next command (which took 10
minutes to complete on my staging machine):

        sudo dd if='2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch-lite.img' of=/dev/sdb bs=4M && sudo sync

Be absolutely sure the command has completed before going on.

Unfortunately `raspbian` is not shipped with the `ssh server` active
by default.  It's possible to overcome this problem by continuing
with the following commands, again substituting your `device name`
with the digit `1` appended to it to make it a `volume name`:

        sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media 
        sudo touch /media/ssh
        sudo sync
        sudo umount /dev/sdb1

Now the SD card is ready for your target machine and, if you wish,
the raspbian image (both the `zip` file and the `img` file) can be
deleted from the `Downloads` directory of your staging machine.

Be sure the micro SD card is securely inserted into the `Raspberry
Pi`  and that you have an Ethernet cable connecting the `Pi` to your
local network (and through it to the Internet.) If using an external
(USB connected) WiFi dongle, make sure it is also installed.
Now power up the `Pi`.
        

### Staging Machine Preparation

From the command line of your **staging** machine, issue the
following commands<sup>[10](#10branch)</sup>:
        
        export BRANCH=master

        cd
        sudo apt-get install git arp-scan
        git clone https://github.com/alexKleider/phInfo.git
        git checkout $BRANCH
        cd phInfo 
        git checkout $BRANCH


### IP Address Discovery

Make sure the **target** machine is connected (via Ethernet cable)
to the internet and is powered up.  (If you are using an external
WiFi dongle it should be installed before power up.)

The challenge now is to discover the IP address of the target
machine.  The utility `find_pi.py` (now within the current file
structure on the staging machine) is provided for this purpose but
will only be of use if your target machine is a `Raspberry Pi`.
Before using it, you will want to open it in your favourite editor
and possibly change the one or two constants to suit your network.
The file is well commented to help guide you.

        python find_pi.py

The output will look something like this:

        Probable Pi IP(s):
            192.168.0.11

If your target machine is not a `Raspberry Pi`, then using the Unix
arp-scan utility before and again after powering up the target machine
will likely work.  Look for an IP address that appears only after the
target power up, not before.


### Log on to the Target Machine

To log on to the target machine you will have to know the appropriate
user's name and password as well as the target's IP address.  For the
`Pi`, the user name is `pi` and the password is `raspberry`.  Still
using the command line of your staging machine, proceed with the
following command, substituting the user name and the IP address as
appropriate<sup>[7](#7nasty)</sup>:

        ssh pi@<target-ip-adr>

Before being asked for a password, you may be warned about host
authenticity.  Simply do what is requested.
After responding to the prompt with the  correct password
('raspberry',) with any luck you will now be logged onto the
target machine (running it 'headless'.)

You will have to repeat this process each time the target machine
goes through a reboot<sup>[6](#6screenfreeze)</sup> or after you
log off.

All subsequent instructions assume that you are logged onto the
target machine using the ssh client on your staging machine.


### Configuring (`raspi-config`) and Upgrading the Pi

Use the command line of your staging machine to log onto the target
`Raspberry Pi` as described in the previous section.  You can safely
ignore the warning about changing the password.  We'll do that in a
moment. Run `raspi-config`:
        
        sudo raspi-config

As its name implies, `raspi-config` is an interactive utility
providing access to the Pi's configuration.  Make selections by
using the up and down arrow keys and once your choice is
highlighted, use the left and right arrow keys to pick `<Select>`
(or `<Finish>`).  Here is an outline of what is recommended or
appropriate for our use case:

    1. Change user password: I've been changing the pw to `pi::root` 
    2. Hostname: I suggest `rpi` or `pi-1` (something short)
    3. Boot options:
        We are not installing a GUI so select B1 (boot into the
        command line interface) following which you will be given
        another list of options and again select B1 (log in
        required.)
    4. Localization Options:
        11 Change Locale: The default is `en_gb.UTF-8`: suitable
            for Great Britain.  For the American locale, scroll down
            (with the down arrow) until encountering the asterisk (*)
            next to `en_gb.UTF-8`, toggle with the space bar, and
            then continue scrolling down until coming to
            `en_us.UTF-8`.  Toggle with the space bar again so the
            asterisk appears. Here the behavior of the interface is
            a bit different: the `Enter` key moves you forward to
            the next panel where you again use the down arrow
            to land on `en_us.UTF-8`.  Use the right arrow and then
            `Enter` over the `<Ok>`.
        Choose option 4 two more times:
        12 Change Time Zone: US, New Pacific
        13 Change Keyboard Layout: 
            Since our goal is to run the `Pi` 'headless',
            I don't think changing any of this is necessary but if you
            do expect to be using a keyboard the following is
            suggested:
            generic 105-key (the default) seems to work
            I chose `Other` rather than the default
            (`English (UK)') and then select 'English (US)'
            There's no reason to change any of the remaining
            defaults.
    5. Interfacing Options:
        Only the second option is relevant to us:
        P2 SSH: Enable ssh server
        Be sure <Yes> is selected, this is very important.
    6. Overclock: Left in the default state.
    7. Advanced options:
        A1 Expand file system: This is also very important.
        None of the other advance options concern us.
    8. Update this tool to latest version
        Optional: not necessary.
    9. About raspi-config
        Nothing important here.

After `raspi-config` completes, reboot the `Pi` as suggested.


### Updating and Upgrading the Raspberry Pi

After the reboot, you'll have to again use the ssh client on your
staging machine to log onto the target machine,
this time using your newly set password (`pi::root`).

This section is specific for the `Raspberry Pi`.  If you are using
some other `Debian` based target, it would probably do no harm to
still try to run the curl command.  If an error is reported then
have a look at the `pi-upgrade.sh` script (part of the `phInfo`
repository.)  You could probably simply run the same commands
individually with only minor modification.

The following (first `curl`) command upgrades `raspbian` components.
(It's best to use copy and past):

        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexKleider/phInfo/master/pi-upgrade.sh | bash -s

The above command ends with a reboot (necessary in order to
implement the new kernel) so wait for a few minutes for the boot
process to complete before logging back on.


### Installation of Utilities

Using your staging machine, log on to your target machine.
The following (second `curl`) command ensures that you are
in the current user's home directory (`/home/pi`,)
installs `git` and then clones the phInfo
repository<sup>[4](#4reponame)</sup>. It takes about
3 minutes to run:

        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexKleider/phInfo/master/repo.sh | bash -s

The clone operation brings in the `phInfo` file hierarchy containing
this `README` as well as required scripts and files. After completion
change into this directory:

        cd phInfo

There are a number of utilities and customizations that are not
essential but I find them useful to have so my practice is to
also run the following script (it takes about 3 minutes):

        ./favourites.sh


### Network Setup

Network configuration is dependent on the target machine's
hardware.  These instructions assume that there is an Ethernet
(eth0) port and either a built in WiFi or a USB WiFi dongle as
is true for the Raspberry Pi. The scripts used will most
certainly have to be modified if this is not your use case.

Configuration is done by commands in the networking.sh and the
iptables.sh scripts. There must be a reboot between the two
<sup>[6](#6screenfreeze)</sup>.
If you think you might want to make any customizations, have
a look through the initial comments in `networking.sh`; you
may want to edit some of the files mentioned.

        cd phInfo
        ./networking.sh
        # You'll have to wait for some utilities to be installed and
        # then for the reboot to take place before logging on again.
        cd phInfo
        ./iptables.sh

The last command also ends with a reboot. Remember that after each
reboot you'll have to use your staging machine to log back on to the
target machine<sup>[6](#6screenfreeze)</sup>.


### Bring in Dependencies

Expect the next script to take a long time
(~30 min., so be patient!)

        cd phInfo
        ./dependencies.sh

### Server Setup

There's no reboot after the last command so you should still be logged
on; be sure you are still in the ~/phInfo directory.
Have a look through the initial comments in `create-server.sh`.
It's unlikely there'll be anything you need to change.

        cd ~/phInfo
        ./create-server.sh

Wait for a few minutes for your target machine to reboot and then
direct your staging machine's WiFi to the target WiFi access point.
The SSID will be 'piServer' unless you've previously changed it by
editing `hostapd.conf`.  If all has gone well, pointing your browser
to `rachel.lan` will take you to the example static HTML home page.
Once the test has passed point your staging machine's WiFi back to
your home network.


### Pathagar Book Server

Choose a database password consisting of alphanumerics, dashes and
underscores but no other special characters. Make a record of it
somewhere so as to be sure not to forget it. I suggest 'db-password'.
Then log on to your target machine as user `pi` and run the following
command:

        export MYSQL_PASSWORD='db-password'

You will also later need a pathagar superuser password so now would
be a good time to pick one and record it somewhere.  I suggest
'ph-su-pw'.

The next sequence of commands brings in Pathagar, and sets up its
environment.  The `pip install -r requirements.pip` command in
`pathagar-setup.sh` script takes a very long time so be patient.
If it fails see footnote<sup>[8](#8piperror)</sup>.
The set-su-pw.sh script prompts you for a *Django SuperUser*.
It'll want you to enter a user name (or default to the current
user,) email and the password- e.g. `ph-su-pw`.

        cd ~/phInfo
        ./pathagar-setup.sh
        ./set-pathagar-su.sh

##### Adding Content

Consult the README file in the `pathagar` directory/repository for
instructions how to load books (and other library content) once
the pathagar server is running.

##### Before Final Deployment

Once everything is working as it should, before putting your
server into service, edit `/home/pi/pathagar/localsettings.py`.
Change `DEBUG = True` to `DEBUG = False`.
You will probably also want to change the value of 
`TIME_ZONE = 'America/Los_Angeles'`
Look at `/usr/share/zoneinfo` on any Linux system for guidance as
to how to specify your particular zone.


### Static Content

To add your own static content simply copy the appropriate
`index.html` file together with any other supporting files to the
`/var/www/static/` directory, thus replacing the test page.

If your content is available on an ext4 formatted USB device with
LABEL=Static, (and you haven't modified the `create-server.sh` code,)
the following will serve as a template for the copy command:

        rsync -av /mnt/Static/<dir-containing-content>/ /var/www/static/

Note that the final slash(`/`) at the end of the first parameter to
`rsync` is important (so that only the content, not the directory
itself, gets copied. Presence or absence of the final slash in 
the second parameter is immaterial.)

If your content is at the top level of the medium you've mounted
(rather than inside its own directory) then change the command to
the following:

        rsync -av /mnt/Static/* /var/www/static/

If your server is the `Raspberry Pi` set up as described here,
then entering "rachel.lan" in the URL window of a browser running
on a WiFi client machine will result in your content being displayed.


### Add Another Static Content Site

Still need to document this.

### FOOTNOTES

<a name="1sdcard">1</a>.
    
    If using a version 2 (or earlier) Pi, you are limited to
    at most a 64GB card.
    Version 3 (or later?) `Raspberry Pi`s require a micro SD
    card.  Some 128GB cards can be used but many sold on the market do
    not work! 


<a name="2arpscan">2</a>.

    There are various methods of discovering the IP address of the
    `Raspberry Pi`.  Use of the `arp-scan` utility is one.  The
    included `find_pi.py` script uses `arp-scan` and might be useful
    to you but it will have to be customized to suit your own network
    and the devices you own.  Edit `find_pi.py` and read its docstring
    for further details.

<a name="3username">3</a>.

    The scripts assume user name `pi` and that you are cloning the
    `phInfo` repository and `pathagar` into `/home/pi`.  If you decide
    on a different user or use of a different installation directory,
    the scripts will have to be modified accordingly

<a name="4reponame">4</a>.

    The repository name may change in which case all references to
    `phInfo` will need to be changed.

<a name="5oldraspian">5</a>

Older versions of raspian can be found 
[here](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/).

<a name="6screenfreeze">6</a>

When using SSH, following a shutdown or a reboot, the client
teminal sometimes freezes.  This can be remedied with the
following 3 key strokes: Enter (the `Enter key`), tilde (`~`),
period (`.`).

<a name="7nasty">7</a>

When attempting to log on you might be presented with a "Host key
verification" failure.
If so, look for a line that ends with ...ssh/known_hosts:7.  Make
a note of the number (in this case it's 7) and then delete the 7th
line (or what ever number it is) in your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.

<a name="8piperror">8</a>

During testing I encountered an error within the `pip install`
command called from `pathagar-setup.sh`.  Details can be found
in the `pip-error.txt` file.  The following script run after the
failure, resulted in recovery:

        ./pip-error.sh


<a name="9cooling">9</a>

Beware (Adam Holt, personal communication) "of your RPi overheating
and self-throttling etc -- be sure to test use the command to monitor
their temperature if folks will be using them in hot (or even warm)
conditions indoors.  A heatsink is not enough.  Many of my Haitian
friends just run their RPi 3s with the top off, which indeed solves
the problem as an indoor breeze is sufficient.  It may seem
unprofession but it works.  Considering most all RPi cases make
practicall ventilation impossible, and active cooling with a
fans-that-break is something nobody's wanted to bother with so far".


<a name="10branch">10</a>

The `export BRANCH=master` and `git checkout $BRANCH` commands
are not necessary unless you are testing a branch other than master:
