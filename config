# File: config

# This configuration file consists of environmental variables
# that can be used to over ride defaults.  If you are happy
# with the recommended defaults provided, this file can be
# ignored.  
#
#If you do want to over ride defaults...
#
# On your staging machine, you need only worry about the
# first two assignments- these can be modified on your staging
# machine and then copied to be run on your target machine 
# as individual commands before running the second curl command.
#
# After that, this file will be with in the repo on your target
# machine where it needs to be edited to your satisfaction.
# Be sure the first two variables are set to the same values
# in the config file on your target machine as you entered on its
# command line before running the second curl command.


# if you wish to change either of the following two defaults,
# edit the values on your staging machine and then copy and
# paste the commands to be run on your target machine just
# before running the second curl command:

# PARENT_DIR designates the directory into which the repo will be
# cloned.  The default is the current user's home directory.
# If changed, be sure you've created the directory and set 
# permissions appropriately.
export PARENT_DIR=$HOME    # Used in repo.sh

# piInfoDIR designates the file system of the repo itself.
# It will be placed within the PARENT_DIR directory.
export piInfoDIR="piInfo"  # Used in repo.sh

# Don't change the next line.
# Suggested that 
# If this isn't meant to be configurable, since it is derived from the
# other variables, maybe we should move it into a separate file?
export REPO=${PARENT_DIR}/${piInfoDIR}
# The pathagar code is hard wired to be within $PARENT_DIR

# AP_IP specifies the IP address of the server's access point.
# ... the one to which client machines will be connecting.
# I can't think of any reason you would want to change this.
export AP_IP="10.10.10.10"  # Used in create-server.sh

# MAIN_USER specifies the user on the target machine.
# If you change this, you'll have to use the same user name
# each time you use your staging machine to log on to the
# target: i.e. `ssh <name-you-choose>@<ethernet-ip-address>`
export MAIN_USER=$USER   # Used in create-server.sh

export LIBRARY_URL='library.lan'  # URL for pathagar book server
export RACHEL_URL='rachel.lan'    # URL for static content (#1)

export DIR4STATIC="/var/www/static"  # directory for static content
export MOUNT_POINT="/mnt/Static"  # a spot to mount static content
                                  # for transfer to $DIR4STATIC 


# The following are hard coded and not configurable.
# (If you think they should be configurable, please contact
# alexKleider@gmail.com)
#
# 00-default  # Apache's default site
# index.html  # The proto static content.
# /etc/apache2/sites-available/static.conf
# static & static.conf  # Apache config file for our static site.


# Suggested that (in branch-testing.txt) 
# maybe we could add the branch name to the config?


# Ignore the following template (used in development):
# Maybe you can turn this into a function if you use it often enough?
echo "Assign my_VAR_NAME variable..."
if [ -z $my_VAR_NAME ]
then
    export my_VAR_NAME="var_name" 
    echo "...defaults to var_name..."
else
    echo "...set to $my_VAR_NAME (by config file)"
