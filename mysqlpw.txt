Right, it actually is the same mysql server. The python virtualenv
only affects python libraries like the mysql _client_. The server
itself is completely separate from python and the virtualenv.

If you set a password during the `apt-get install`, you'll have to
specify it here with `mysql --password=your_password`. If you forgot
it, I think you can run something like dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server
to reset it, although google would know for sure.

In my original instructions, I probably did not set a root password,
so the root user could log in without any extra password. I'll have
to check the docs on whether setting a root password for mysql is
good or not. With postgres, setting a password only complicates
things and does not provide any additional security.

Recover MySQL root password

You can recover a MySQL database server password with the following
five easy steps:

Step # 1: Stop the MySQL server process.

Step # 2: Start the MySQL (mysqld) server/daemon process with the
--skip-grant-tables option so that it will not prompt for a password.

Step # 3: Connect to the MySQL server as the root user.

Step # 4: Set a new root password.

Step # 5: Exit and restart the MySQL server.


 Here are the commands you need to type for each step (log in as the
 root user):

 Step # 1 : Stop the MySQL service:

 # /etc/init.d/mysql stop

 Output:

 Stopping MySQL database server: mysqld.



Step # 2: Start the MySQL server w/o password:

# mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &

Output:

[1] 5988
Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql
mysqld_safe[6025]: started

Step # 3: Connect to the MySQL server using the MySQL client:


# mysql -u root

Output:

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 1 to server version: 4.1.15-Debian_1-log

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql>



Step # 4: Set a new MySQL root user password:

mysql> use mysql;
mysql> update user set password=PASSWORD("NEW-ROOT-PASSWORD") where
User='root';
mysql> flush privileges;
mysql> quit



Step # 5: Stop the MySQL server:

# /etc/init.d/mysql stop

Output:

Stopping MySQL database server: mysqld
STOPPING server from pid file /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
mysqld_safe[6186]: ended

[1]+  Done                    mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables

Start the MySQL server and test it:

# /etc/init.d/mysql start
# mysql -u root -p
